# Musical Instrument Recognition System using Artificial Neural Networks


## Introduction
In this study, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were used to compare different characteristics of musical instruments and study their ability to distinguish a range of instruments. This was performed using the frequency spectrum of the audio signal, together with an , comparing the accuracy of the network in the cases of the following experiments.
* The whole sample
* The attack of the sound
* Everything but the attack of the sound
* The initial 100 Hz of the frequency spectrum
* The following 900 Hz of the frequency spectrum
